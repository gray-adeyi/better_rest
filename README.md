# Better Rest
A tutorial project on creating restful
api endpoints in django using django rest
framework.

## Notice
I did not freeze the dependencies to get
this app working because i was working 
with termix on my phone with a limited
storage space to create project specific
virtual envs. But, you should be good to
go after installing the current versions
of these python packages.

## Setup
`bash pip3 install django, djangorestframework, pygments
./manage.py runserver`
